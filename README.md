Downloads
---------

If you have come across this colorscheme via the [Vim-only repository] on 
github, or the [vim.org script] page see the link above to the Solarized 
homepage or visit the main [Solarized repository].

The [Vim-only repository] is kept in sync with the main [Solarized repository] 
and is for installation convenience only (with [Pathogen] or [Vundle], for 
instance).  Issues, bug reports, changelogs are centralized at the main 
[Solarized repository].

Installation
------------

### Option 1: Manual installation

1.  Move `solarized.vim` to your `.vim/colors` directory. After downloading the 
    vim script or package:

        $ cd vim-colors-solarized/colors
        $ mv solarized.vim ~/.vim/colors/

### Option 2: Pathogen installation ***(recommended)***

1.  Download and install Tim Pope's [Pathogen].

2.  Next, move or clone the `vim-colors-solarized` directory so that it is 
    a subdirectory of the `.vim/bundle` directory.

    a. **Clone:** 

            $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
            $ git clone git://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized.git

    b. **Move:**

        In the parent directory of vim-colors-solarized:
        
            $ mv vim-colors-solarized ~/.vim/bundle/

### Modify .vimrc

After either Option 1 or Option 2 above, put the following two lines in your 
.vimrc:

    set background=dark
    colorscheme solarized

or, for the light background mode of Solarized:

    set background=light
    colorscheme solarized

I like to have a different background in GUI and terminal modes, so I can use 
the following if-then. However, I find vim's background autodetection to be 
pretty good and, at least with MacVim, I can leave this background value 
assignment out entirely and get the same results.

    if has('gui_running')
        set background=light
    else
        set background=dark
    endif

See the [Solarized homepage][Solarized] for screenshots which will help you 
select either the light or dark background.

### IMPORTANT NOTE FOR TERMINAL USERS:

If you are going to use Solarized in Terminal mode (i.e. not in a GUI version 
like gvim or macvim), **please please please** consider setting your terminal 
emulator's colorscheme to used the Solarized palette. I've included palettes 
for some popular terminal emulator as well as Xdefaults in the official 
Solarized download available from [Solarized homepage][Solarized]. If you use 
Solarized without these colors, Solarized will by default use an approximate 
set of 256 colors. It isn't bad looking and has been extensively tweaked, but 
it's still not quite the real thing.

If you do use the custom terminal colors, simply add the following line 
*before* the `colorscheme solarized` line:

    let g:solarized_termcolors=16

Advanced Configuration
----------------------

Solarized will work out of the box with just the two lines specified above but 
does include several other options that can be set in your .vimrc file.

Set these in your vimrc file prior to calling the colorscheme.
"
    option name               default     optional
    ------------------------------------------------
    g:solarized_termcolors=   256     |   16
    g:solarized_termtrans =   0       |   1
    g:solarized_degrade   =   0       |   1
    g:solarized_bold      =   1       |   0
    g:solarized_underline =   1       |   0
    g:solarized_italic    =   1       |   0
    g:solarized_style     =   "dark"  |   "light"
    g:solarized_contrast  =   "normal"|   "high" or "low"
    ------------------------------------------------

### Option Details

*   g:solarized_termcolors

    **The most important option** if you are using vim in terminal (non gui) 
    mode! See my diatribe above regarding terminal colors. This tells Solarized 
    to use the 256 degraded color mode if running in a 256 color capable 
    terminal.  Otherwise, if set to `16` it will use the terminal emulators 
    colorscheme (best option as long as you've set the emulators colors to the 
    Solarized palette).

*   g:solarized_termtrans

    If you use a terminal emulator with a transparent background and Solarized 
    isn't displaying the background color transparently, set this to 1 and 
    Solarized will use the default (transparent) background of the terminal 
    emulator. *urxvt* required this in my testing; Terminal.app/iTerm2 did not.

*   g:solarized_degrade

    For test purposes only; forces Solarized to use the 256 degraded color mode 
    to test the approximate color values for accuracy.

*   g:solarized_bold | g:solarized_underline | g:solarized_italic

    If you wish to stop Solarized from displaying bold, underlined or 
    italicized typefaces, simply assign a zero value to the appropriate 
    variable, for example: `let g:solarized_italic=0`

*   g:solarized_style

    Simply another way to force Solarized to use a dark or light background.  
    It's better to use `set background=dark` or `set background=light` in your 
    .vimrc file. This option is mostly used in scripts (quick background color 
    change) or for testing.

*   g:solarized_contrast

    Stick with normal! It's been carefully tested. Setting this option to high 
    or low does use the same Solarized palette but simply shifts some values up 
    or down in order to expand or compress the tonal range displayed.

### **IMPORTANT NOTE FOR TERMINAL USERS**

If you are running vim in a terminal, Solarized will run in 256 color mode if 
the terminal supports it, but those 256 colors are (in all 256 color terminal 
emulators) limited to a "degraded" color palette.  While the colors will all 
approximate the specific Solarized color values, if you prefer an accurate 
color palette you can set the ANSI colors in your terminal and use the 16 color 
terminal mode using the g:solarized_termcolors="16" option detailed below. The 
ANSI color map is specified in the table below and terminal color themes are 
available for download from the web page listed at the top of this file, 
including xorg defaul color values and themes for OS X Terminal.app and iTerm2.

Toggle Background Function
--------------------------

Here's a quick script that toggles the background color, using F5 in this 
example. You can drop this into .vimrc:

    function! ToggleBackground()
        if (g:solarized_style=="dark")
        let g:solarized_style="light"
        colorscheme solarized
    else
        let g:solarized_style="dark"
        colorscheme solarized
    endif
    endfunction
    command! Togbg call ToggleBackground()
    nnoremap <F5> :call ToggleBackground()<CR>
    inoremap <F5> <ESC>:call ToggleBackground()<CR>a
    vnoremap <F5> <ESC>:call ToggleBackground()<CR>

Code Notes
----------

Use folding to view the `solarized.vim` script with `foldmethod=marker` turned 
on.

I have attempted to modularize the creation of Vim colorschemes in this script 
and, while it could be refactored further, it should be a good foundation for 
the creation of any color scheme. By simply changing the sixteen values in the 
GUI section and testing in gvim (or mvim) you can rapidly prototype new 
colorschemes without diving into the weeds of line-item editing each syntax 
highlight declaration.

The Values
----------

L\*a\*b values are canonical (White D65, Reference D50), other values are 
matched in sRGB space.
